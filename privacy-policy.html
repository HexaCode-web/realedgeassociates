                  1. Introduction
                </h5>
                <p>
                  We are committed to respecting your online privacy, and
                  recognize your need for appropriate protection and management
                  of any personally identifiable information ("Personal
                  Information") you share with us.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Personal Information means any information that may be used to
                  identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first
                  and last name, personal profile, a home or other physical
                  address and an email address or other contact information,
                  whether at work or at home. Currently, we do not require you
                  to provide Personal Information in order to have access to the
                  free commentary, analysis and news available on our Site.
                  However, in order to provide you with some of the Site's
                  services, you must create a profile, register and provide your
                  email address, username, password and other specified
                  information. At a later time, you may add additional Personal
                  Information to your profile.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you are a registered user, you will have your own Realedge
                  Associate email account ("Realedge Associate Email Account").
                  By using your Realedge Associate Email Account, you may send
                  messages to and receive messages from other registered users
                  and contributors. You are strictly prohibited from sending
                  unsolicited or unauthorized advertisements, spam, chain
                  letters, etc. Any information that you send within such a
                  message is visible only to the message recipients. Please note
                  that some actions you take, such as replying to a topic,
                  posting comments, etc. may subscribe you automatically to
                  getting notifications to your Realedge Associate email
                  account. Please further note that some notifications, such as
                  a notification for receiving a private message to your
                  Realedge Associate email account, may be enabled by default.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We may use your email address and Realedge Associate email
                  account to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding our
                  services, and those of our advertisers who may have relevant
                  offers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You may choose not to receive email from a particular sender
                  by rolling your mouse over the text of an email in your
                  Realedge Associate email account and blocking that sender. If
                  you receive the email from Realedge Associate in an email
                  account other than your Realedge Associate email account and
                  wish to block that sender, simply go into your Realedge
                  Associate email account and block that sender in the same way.
                  Furthermore, if you do not wish to receive email from one of
                  our advertisers, you may unsubscribe from receiving further
                  email from that advertiser.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on
                  the Site, we may transfer that Personal Information within
                  Realedge Associate or to Realedge Associate's third-party
                  service providers, but only to provide services on the Site,
                  across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other
                  countries or jurisdictions around the world. The services
                  provided by our third-party service providers may include
                  fulfilling orders, providing customer service and marketing
                  assistance, performing business and sales analysis, supporting
                  our website functionality, and supporting contests, surveys
                  and other features offered through our Site. If any
                  transactions are conducted, such as your subscribing to
                  Realedge Associate Pro, we may also share your name, contact
                  information and credit card information with our authorized
                  service providers who process credit card payments. These
                  service providers may have access to personal information
                  needed to perform their functions, and will process it in
                  accordance with their privacy policies. Our current credit
                  card service provider is "Braintree"; we recommend reading
                  their privacy policy. The above provisions do not apply to
                  personal information you provide us as a contributor such as
                  date of birth or address. However, contributor details may be
                  shared with our secure third party identification partners for
                  the purpose of verifying contributor identities. Our current
                  identity verification partner is "Idology"; we recommend
                  reading their privacy policy.

                  Personal Information or any information you submitted via the
                  Site and its services (including via your Realedge Associate
                  email account) if we have a good faith belief that disclosure
                  of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to i)
                  comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or
                  governmental request, ii) enforce our Terms of Service
                  including investigations of potential violations thereof, iii)
                  detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security
                  issues, or iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or
                  safety of Realedge Associate, its users, yourself or the
                  public.
