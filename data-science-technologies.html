              <h3>Data Science Technologies</h3>
              <p>
                As large data sets and fast computation become critical to
                effective data science products new technologies have emerged.
                REA have expert technologists to advise in the most effective
                solutions to support your product.

              <p>
                <strong>Column-oriented databases</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Traditional, row-oriented databases are excellent for online
                transaction processing with high update speeds, but they fall
                short on query performance as the data volumes grow and as data
                becomes more unstructured. Column-oriented databases store data
                with a focus on columns, instead of rows, allowing for huge data
                compression and very fast query times. The downside to these
                databases is that they will generally only allow batch updates,
                having a much slower update time than traditional models.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Schema-less databases, or NoSQL databases</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                There are several database types that fit into this category,
                such as key-value stores and document stores, which focus on the
                storage and retrieval of large volumes of unstructured,
                semi-structured, or even structured data. They achieve
                performance gains by doing away with some (or all) of the
                restrictions traditionally associated with conventional
                databases, such as read-write consistency, in exchange for
                scalability and distributed processing.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>MapReduce</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                This is a programming paradigm that allows for massive job
                execution scalability against thousands of servers or clusters
                of servers. Any MapReduce implementation consists of two
                tasks:<br />
                The "Map" task, where an input dataset is converted into a
                different set of key/value pairs, or tuples;<br />
                The "Reduce" task, where several of the outputs of the "Map"
                task are combined to form a reduced set of tuples (hence the
                name).
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Hadoop</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Hadoop is by far the most popular implementation of MapReduce,
                being an entirely open source platform for handling Big Data. It
                is flexible enough to be able to work with multiple data
                sources, either aggregating multiple sources of data in order to
                do large scale processing, or even reading data from a database
                in order to run processor-intensive machine learning jobs. It
                has several different applications, but one of the top use cases
                is for large volumes of constantly changing data, such as
                location-based data from weather or traffic sensors, web-based
                or social media data, or machine-to-machine transactional data.

              <p>
                <strong>Hive</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Hive is a "SQL-like" bridge that allows conventional BI
                applications to run queries against a Hadoop cluster. It was
                developed originally by Facebook, but has been made open source
                for some time now, and it's a higher-level abstraction of the
                Hadoop framework that allows anyone to make queries against data
                stored in a Hadoop cluster just as if they were manipulating a
                conventional data store. It amplifies the reach of Hadoop,
                making it more familiar for BI users.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>PIG</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                PIG is another bridge that tries to bring Hadoop closer to the
                realities of developers and business users, similar to Hive.
                Unlike Hive, however, PIG consists of a "Perl-like" language
                that allows for query execution over data stored on a Hadoop
                cluster, instead of a "SQL-like" language. PIG was developed by
                Yahoo!, and, just like Hive, has also been made fully open
                source.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>WibiData</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                WibiData is a combination of web analytics with Hadoop, being
                built on top of HBase, which is itself a database layer on top
                of Hadoop. It allows web sites to better explore and work with
                their user data, enabling real-time responses to user behavior,
                such as serving personalized content, recommendations and
                decisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>PLATFORA</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Perhaps the greatest limitation of Hadoop is that it is a very
                low-level implementation of MapReduce, requiring extensive
                developer knowledge to operate. Between preparing, testing and
                running jobs, a full cycle can take hours, eliminating the
                interactivity that users enjoyed with conventional databases.
                PLATFORA is a platform that turns user's queries into Hadoop
                jobs automatically, thus creating an abstraction layer that
                anyone can exploit to simplify and organize datasets stored in
                Hadoop.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Storage Technologies</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                As the data volumes grow, so does the need for efficient and
                effective storage techniques. The main evolutions in this space
                are related to data compression and storage virtualization.
              </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <h3>Big Data in the cloud</h3>
              <p>
                Most of these technologies are closely associated with the
                cloud. Most cloud vendors are already offering hosted Hadoop
                clusters that can be scaled on demand according to their user's
                needs. Also, many of the products and platforms mentioned are
                either entirely cloud-based or have cloud versions themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                Big Data and cloud computing go hand-in-hand. Cloud computing
                enables companies of all sizes to get more value from their data
                than ever before, by enabling blazing-fast analytics at a
                fraction of previous costs. This, in turn drives companies to
                acquire and store even more data, creating more need for
                processing power and driving a virtuous circle.
